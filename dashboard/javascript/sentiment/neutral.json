In particular there is a huge gap for service based businesses. There is no funding available to those to help grow their business but yet they could have huge potential. Enterprise Ireland does refer to Ireland's service based businesses but this message is not being carried down through the LEO's, therefore lots of of service based businesses are constantly having to bootstrap and this delays growth hugely. We definitely need some sort of thinking outside the box on this issue. Some sort of student business collaboration would be super.  Not everyone will be eligible for an innovation voucher for example. "

There is also the issue that we will have to renew our contracts, and may be hard pressed to find alternative accommodation.

We also had a group of staff run the mini-marathon for a specific cause (another great way of bringing colleagues together, both through practice walks, and getting together on the day).  All of these were issues affecting a colleague in some way, and the staff response was excellent.  They are also a wonderful way to bring colleagues together.

So for me, the question is not what new modules we should have, but how can we integrate these generic skills, when should we teach them, where and how. For example, in the national project on digital literacies for language learning and teaching, it came very clear at the very beginning of the project that you could not separate digital literacies from language and from culture. But by working on the three together, learners can transfer their new skills to other languages and other domains. "
