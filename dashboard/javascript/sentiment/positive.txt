It's a very different world than when I was a student there and I believe as a Psychologist, there is a huge need for core skills like Flexibility, Resilience, Pragmatism and Strategic Thinking as well as Emotional Intelligence and even Influence skills. Extracurricular activities that promote or provide opportunities for students to learn and develop these skills I think would be very useful. Qualifications, even from a great institution like DCU, are only one part of what it takes for students to live a happy and successful life after university. To me, I think it would be great if there were chances for them to get experience in handling the kind of problems or challenges that they'll face in the real world. Their ability to work around problems with different solutions, focusing on solutions over problems, thinking long term and creating thought out strategies, handling their emotions, reading other people and influencing those they work with and know are all crucial skills nowadays. Most important of all, handling adversity and being resilient in the face of struggles and disappointment is so important. The college experience is amazing in so many ways but nowadays you can't get away with knowing, you have to be able to communicate it as effectively as possible. "

I have been fortunate enough to receive a sports scholarship from DCU and I cannot thank them enough for the support they have given me both academically and in my sporting career so far. I am currently on tour in India with the Irish team and DCU have been fantastic. On the academic side, they have taken an active interest in my sport and provided me with much needed extensions in terms of assignments and continuous assessments. On the sporting side, I have been provided with top class facilities  to training such as the high performance gym/pool/ice baths and much more. As well as this, DCU have provided the opportunity to attend masterclasses in a number of areas such as S&amp;C, nutrition and recovery. All of the above, have made it possible for me to achieve my dream of playing professional cricket and to further my education at the same time. As I have said before, I cannot thank DCU enough. In the future, I hope DCU will continue to provide the support and encouragement that I have benefited from to other aspiring athletes. "

Its almost 20 yrs since I left DCU and Ireland now so I have really always been an alum in absentia!  This makes it hard to be involved in supporting the Uni and engaging students as an alum (career nights etc) and means that the alumni aspect is more a social network.  While both are important obviously, I think enabling alumni who are abroad, to know more about what is going on at all levels within the organization would be great.  Even if I cant attend a career night, if I know one is happening I might try and follow it on twitter or find out about what types of places/people were presenting, where the graduating 4th yrs from my degree are now going etc..  Our Alumni Office here work very hard to help/connect students with alumni in all walks of life and there seems to constantly be networking events both on and off campus.  Again, because I've only ever been a DCU alum living abroad, maybe this is happening all the time, but the updates from the Alumni Office tend to be more about social events for alumni rather than alumni-student events.  I would love to get more regular updates from the alumni office telling me about any great achievements by undergrads (I teach undergrads so they are my priority everywhere!!), school-wide events relevant to my degree program etc..I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the posts today and it has given me renewed DCU pride:) "

However - it is important that an assessment of need ( and also the students hardware/ broadband access etc) is done early in the programme as quite often we assume everyone has the same ability/ broadband access etc.  Real time events don't  always work out. Another thing which needs bearing in mind is the marketing for the programmes. Its important that the right audiences are targeted for these programmes. As a user of technology in the classroom - I think it can 'augment' the learning reality ( when used properly).  There is a skill to it though. In terms of augmented reality - I think there is fantastic scope for DCU to be leaders here. There is great potential. . . But of course it needs time and money. I'm not sure about VR yet myself - but I'm sure there is great potential too. We need to make careful decisions and prioritise the important areas ( within programmes) which would benefit most from enhancement through technological means.

        "content": "Just returning to the question of what conditions promote creativity way back in the mid 1970s Arieti proposed nine socio-cultural factors which underpin what he called ‘creativogenic culture’, that is, a culture which facilitates, but does not guarantee, the realisation of creative potential. These factors include the availability of cultural resources, freedom of access to cultural media, openness and exposure to diversity as well as tolerance of diverse perspectives, incentives and rewards for creative action, and ability to interact with significant cultural agents. More recently, people like Charles Landry and Richard Florida have further considered this with reference to the idea of ‘creative cities’. If we take DCU as a mini city, that has its own culture, then I suppose for the next strategic plan, if we wish to really strongly push the idea of fostering staff and student creativity (which in turn would make DCU a force for creativity in Ireland), then it would be useful to work on identifying the specific conditions that are relevant to us based on existing models, and perhaps modify or add to these, and then take action to ensure these conditions are met. From there, creative potential could further develop across the university. As I mentioned in my opening statement yesterday, DCU Fuse itself is a high creative endeavour for DCU and, as I think most will agree, has stimulated far more spontaneous interaction and ideation among all stakeholders than any other initiative to date.

I'm currently studying a postgrad on the St Pats campus, and I studied my undergrad in Glasnevin a number of years beforehand.Just to add a couple of ideas...I think if more clubs and socs could make their presence known in the Pats campus it would be beneficial. I loved my time in Glasnevin - there was so much to do during the days and evenings alike, plenty of events at lunch time or during free periods. I feel there's less opportunity for a similar social interaction on St Pats campus at the moment.Some mindfulness or yoga classes or sessions for students would be so great to have as well - across all of DCU! I was able to participate in a mindfulness 4 week course in Pats last semester, and I felt it was really helpful to have that 50 minutes once a week to slow things down and take stock. I learned some useful strategies as well. I wonder if maybe this could be something facilitated by fellow students even. Or a meditation room, where if people are finding the day or assignment build up a little stressful or overwhelming, that they could enter into a calming space for a few minutes and just breathe, as such. Along the same lines, there may be students who wish to share a skill they have outside of their college course, maybe they could be given a platform to do so. Perhaps through a standing meet up, open mic style where they have an opportunity to present information they have or share research they've done on a subject that interests them. "

The APP will keep historical data on Co2 emissions, usage and cost, on a daily, weekly and monthly basis. The APP also give a comparison to average usage helping to encourage a competitive environment to help reduce consumption. With the GatewayEnergyAPP our residents will learn how to properly manage their energy usage. We look forward to sharing the results of our work on Sustainability with all in DCU.

I can speak only for DC, but we are a very small community here - I think there are only 40 DCU alumni in the general area, so it would be good to have a formal way to connect to other DCU grads across the country here.   Many of the DC DCU alumni travel a lot for work, or have jobs that mean connections across the US and it would be good to have a way to connect with others outside of our area....as you say the alumni profiles are different in each city. As mentioned above it would be great to be updated on achievements of existing students/graduates and to be made aware of student-alumni events.Also, DCU has relationships with several US universities, with students coming out on programmes each year....that could be useful information for alumni who may be able to help the students/offer local advice/office visits or other experiences that would add to the students' study abroad programme in the US. The US universities, in general, have excellent alumni engagement programmes, so I think in particular DCU alumni in the US would be receptive to greater engagement as there is already an awareness of such a model.Also, in areas of the US (or elsewhere) where there is only a small number of DCU people, perhaps a link up option with the alumni of other Irish universities might be mutually beneficial?In addition, an option to avail of continuing professional education might be useful for alumni...not necessarily the commitment of a whole degree programme, but perhaps certain modules that could be offered online? Indeed that could be an area where DCU's existing relationships with US universities could be beneficial....a sort of alumni reciprocation programme? "

For an AHSS researcher, it is important that any STEM publications that result from interdisciplinary research be fairly recognised against AHSS publications, and vice versa for STEM researchers (I am speaking here as an AHSS researcher about to begin an interdisciplinary AHSS-STEM project with a colleague in the School of Chemical Sciences). As an example around refereed international journal articles, perhaps we could coordinate across the various ranking systems that Schools/Faculty units use, such as Thomson Reuters JCR, Association of Business Schools, and so on, to develop a unified internal ranking system for recognising all research output? There are obviously other solutions across other dimensions (funding, conferences, and so on). DCU is certainly strong on interdisciplinary research but any additional measures to encourage researchers to move out of disciplinary silos can only be a good thing for the national and international research profile of the University.

For me, familiarity with other institutions is important - knowledge about what they teach in cognate areas, who teaches there, what kind of research they do, what kind of institution it is, what kind of city, and how their international office helps visiting staff. Partner institutions need to be accessible to each other for staff to have the confidence to travel and engage meaningfully in teaching in the other institution and talk about research with colleagues there, including collaboration in developing courses and strong research projects. There needs to be a pay-off. Enhanced student experience in host institutions is a big one. But staff need academic recognition and encouragement to engage. There needs to be a school and faculty strategy about who we want to cooperate with and what we want to achieve. But, more information about partner institutions is important. "

Encouraging creativity is important but, unfortunately, for students results are what we will be judged on going forward. Perhaps giving strict rubrics could be going too far but something needs to be done to enable students to improve year-on-year. Right now, students in some modules have no idea why they are receiving certain grades and how they can potentially improve them. We have a limited amount of time in third-level education and a limited amount of assignments with which to experiment with to find out how to improve a grade. There has to be a way to let students know what can be done to improve their work. The idea of assignments being \"open to interpretation\" is great, but only if the people grading the assignments are also open to alternative interpretations. Finding a happy medium will undoubtedly be a difficult task but even a small improvement could yield great results for our student population. "

I think there is considerable scope for further outreach work into communities through other initiatives that DCU could support. For example Northside Partnership has a really interesting project called Comuniversity which is run with NUI Maynooth. Through this initiative lecturers from Maynooth come out to Coolock Library and run short courses in humanities. Approximately 30 people graduate each year with a number going on to more formal programmes in Maynooth.

For example, Genetics students when I was an undergrad a few years ago did no heavy computation or coding.  Few modules concentrated on learning basic Logic (the difficult part of programming and a very transferable skill).  In the last 2 years a number of modules have changed or been added to the Genetics B.Sc. Most of these focus heavily on teaching computation skills, math and  (by proxy)basic logic.  For me, it is a fantastic thing to see a degree adapt so quickly.  Having a B.Sc. in genetics really limits someone (who is genuinely interested in genetics) to a single type of classical research.  There is a strong need for students with biological backgrounds to understand computation on a level of coding - I feel the faculty have responded to this fantastically.   I have no idea about other courses, but I feel very strongly that this should be the essence of every DCU course  - undergrad/postgrad.   To do this is a lot of work in my eyes, one that should have great supports to ensure it happens in all courses.   Making studies relevant will put DCU beyond many who cannot adapt so quickly. It should be a hallmark of DCU. "

I would suggest that there needs to be a caring and more respectful approach to the student cohort perhaps ascertaining their expectations also as they vary given the particular programmes of study. In the School of Nursing and Human Sciences for example, we have general nursing cohorts who have 2 graduation ceremonies (1 with their parent hospital and 1 with DCU). These students identify with 2 institutions. Other cohorts such as Health and Society only have 1 graduation and may have differing needs and expectations when it comes to alumni relations. My suggestions to improve alumni relations overall are as follows:-ask current students early in their studies what they would like in terms of an alumni experience. - ask staff who know these programmes best about what might work best. - be mindful that expectations may vary by programme of study and perhaps arrange smaller scale events which relate to it. I.e run programme specific events. - NB - ask students early in their programme to provide an email /postal address they would like to receive correspondence from post graduation. -do not ask alumni for money - it's more about cultivating a sense of identity and loyalty. - have pictures of alumni in the buildings they relate to so current students can see them and be inspired. The chief nurse in Ireland is an alumni of DCU but (in spite of several nominations) has not been chosen to go on the Alumni wall in the library. If her picture was in the nursing building for example - that would mean something to current students. - have some kind of way in which the photos of those who have gone before could be captured and viewed. - offer small incentives for alumni to come back and speak to current students. Sorry for the long email - I just want to put these ideas out there. Good luck with this initiative! "

I mentioned in another post the study that Buse Gamze Ustundag conducted into the experience of international students on campus. One of the key findings from her work is that DCU is a thriving multicultural campus but less so an intercultural one.

Interacting with diverse perspectives is a key variable. Creativity is stimulated when we are faced with different ways of doing things. In DCU, that would mean promoting more contact across disciplines. The built environment is important as well. The institution at any level has to explicitly value and reward creativity, to encourage ideas, to avoid the tendency to criticise ideas that 'will never work'!'.

Every single group chose a charity fundraiser and raised hundreds of euros, in one case over €700 from one student's project - all for charities of their choice. If we chose a theme each year, and encouraged (but did not stipulate!) all students to think of that cause (charity of their choice within that cause) for whatever efforts they had in their curricular or extra-curricular work, we could have a huge cumulative effect. It could get staff talking to each other about cross-disciplinary, or inter-campus activities and lead to more gelling between staff.

There was a wall full of screens broadcasting films, documentaries, news from ca 30 different countries (in as many different languages). Students had wireless headsets and were tuning in depending on what language they wanted to listen to. The same 'Village' had a tandem language learning area / section with information about different study/work abroad opportunities.

How can we build those structures into the programming for the new Student Centre. How will we support the students based on AH and SPD campus who don't have the luxury of the GLA campus infrastructure under their feet (it's a time and money-consuming bus ride away). How can we embed creativity, social innovation into each and every degree we offer - as a core module or as an optional module. Many students mention it to me. Do we have structures that force students to chose between doing well in their degree or effecting social change, because they are too busy studying, commuting and working to earn money.

I got some assessments through the ACCESS  service in DCU in 1st year that thought me about my style of learning.  I think making doing such quick assessments as part of the registration process would be of great benefit.   If I was lecturing a class and I understood the distribution of learning styles in the room, lessons could be tailored to suit this.

The common denominator for me is that I had a defined role to play....and this 'defined' engagement made it easy to feel like I was making a contribution.I don't do the coffees, social gatherings etc. as I just find the day too busy and too short - and I'm sure I am not the only one...but maybe this sense of doing something worthwhile while not necessarily at the desk or at a meeting is worth looking at for like-minded people?food for thought maybe...

Certainly the second level system with the strong focus on CAO points does not foster this and then, in higher education, we do not necessarily sufficiently embrace it either. I think by the time students get to university many of them have fixed, and perhaps incorrect, ideas about creativity. Ideas like some people are 'creative' and other people are not, when in reality everyone has the potential to be creative across multiple domains. People also tend to think of creativity primarily in terms of the arts (music, dance, painting, drama),  - \"John is a painter, he is very creative\" - when they are simply domains, just like nursing, nanotechnology, politics etc. that use a particular medium. I think one of the challenges in higher education is to instill in students this idea that every one of them has the potential to come up with creative ideas in their area of study - or even outside it. And going back to your point, not being afraid to articulate tentative ideas is central to this. "

We need to do more of this in the new Student Building - the passion is there - we need to provide the structures and framework. We should consider embedding practical civic engagement into every degree we offer - not only in the usual disciplines (health, humanities etc) but also in those disciplines where the relevance might not be completely clear.

I would like to confess that while I was in secondary school the idea of going to college seemed a bit distant and inaccessible to me. I studied in a DEIS school, so the majority of students seemed to lack the necessary support at home and as a result of this I believe that they did not perform according to their ability in school. This made it more difficult for the rest of us to concentrate during class as the teachers would always have to deal with various situations involving less motivated students. Also, I believe that constantly dealing with such situations, places an increasing amount of stress and pressure on the teachers, thus making it more difficult to teach and explore important topics with the students, so in scome cases this might lead to a poorer performance of all the students.I believe that DCU has made significant efforts to promote third level education among secondary school students. I say this as I have benefited from these efforts as I attended various workshops and summer school programmes in DCU. I attended Take 5, DCU Shadowing Day, etc. Also, I benefited from having access to free  maths support from DCU student tutors. Looking back on my progress I believe I wouldn't have been able to achieve this much without the continued support of my teachers and without having access to DCU's events and supports. I believe that attending these workshops helped me develop a better perspective of the things that I could achieve and limited the effects of studying in a DEIS school, where due to socio-economic disadvantages, the standards of learning were somewhat lower than in other non-DEIS schools.It is important that DCU continues to offer these supports and maybe more, to students in DEIS schools, in order to allow a greater and wider access to third level education for these students.

I worry about this a lot because a lot of my class time is spent on problem-solving but the consequence is that I get through very little material. I also get the feeling that the active approach doesn't suit everyone. Some students just like to sit an listen and do the hard thinking on their own in peace and quiet - and there's nothing wrong with that. I was like that myself! "

Great work in Eindhoven with the Studio for Connected Society where design principles are used to address social issues.

I think this approach needs to be implemented more in third level, where students are forced to look at presentations and listen to lecturers for an hour and 40 minutes.

In relation to food for students as mentioned in a previous post here, there should be facilities for students to make food instead of having to buy their food every day.

Due to extended library times there should be more food options available like vending machines or extended canteen hours etc.    The food facilities on the weekends are very poor with only the library cafe and the gym cafe being open and they have quite limited food options. It would be important for students who cant afford to go home on weekends as well as exchange students to have more options nearby. 3. More parking spaces should be made available. 4.

Through the Disability Service we support many students at a PG level, that are struggling with the lack of structure, serious financial difficulties, deferrals, family care, poor supervision/supervision relationship, and mental health difficulties (which may be pre-existing or emerge in combination with personal issues and the pressure of PhD). There is now more than ever a huge step up from the quality of work expected at UG level and PG. I have worked with PhD students who have not done any kind of research previously (!) and have no knowledge of how to structure their work, especially where there is little input from supervisors. These students often struggle to find their voice in their writing, but also to find their voice to seek support. It can be a lonely and isolating time for them, and it is our collective responsibility to support them better. I think more clarification around what the demands of PG work are would be helpful, and perhaps departments when discussing this with potential students could highlight this. Smart students who sailed through UG work are not necessarily suited to PG work, as they may not have or struggle to develop the independent research skills necessary to stick with a project for 4 or more years. Would be happy to discuss this with anyone off line! "

Most the employers in India basically prefer graduates graduates from USA over other countries. They also prefer if the student has some experience of working internationally either through internship or full time job.Also, they prefer students from triple accredited business school (EQUIS, ACCSB,AMBA) over dual or single accredit business school.Rankings like FT, ET etc if the student is a business school graduate also plays a crucial role.

Interestingly, on a previous course, I spent some time in Latvia and viewing tutorials, coloborating was so much better - and productive. As well as the colleges, hubs of learning could be available in local communities. If all villages had high-speeb broadband, it could be a way of students using local facilities. But no more than tying to change the way primary and post-primary education is delivered, changing the way third level operates will involve resistance. But I do believe that MOOCs, are setting the pace. I've even used free and affordable onlne courses to help me understand some of the topics, I'm studying on my postgrad courses. "

At the same time, libraries have to be everything to everyone, just as much as we have to collect in print as well as digital.

Innovation cannot exist without creativity. In terms of creating a culture that promotes this. Culture is about valuing something (in this case placing a value on creativity and innovation) and then having that value system manifested through the norms, structures and behaviours within a society, organisation, or - in our case - a university.

I completely agree that this is a valuable skill for students to have but we weren't actually shown how to write and run code using platforms and applications that employers actually use. In my first two weeks on INTRA and during my interview process I was introduced to at least 10 different applications that employers use, applications that were never once mentioned to me in college. I have since been introduced to even more applications and I am using them on a daily basis now. I think if students were able to gain first hand experience using these applications, they would find the initial few weeks of INTRA a lot easier. "

Due to their locations in the hearts of these neighborhoods they have been a focal point for improvements. It's my hope that with the presence of DCU and its adjacent campuses now that greater gentrification will occur. Whether this be new supermarkets, coffee shops etc - these types of businesses should be hungrier for a share of the pie with so many students living in the area.

Also small clubs and societies in the college are very good for making many friends as you see the same people over and over and you can get to know them well.

Greg, Richard and others have asked the question of how best to do this and I think this is tied to impact, as defined by the agencies/organisations who would be responsible for funding research in the priority areas chosen. Notwithstanding the sometimes deeply flawed definitions of impact put forth by these agencies, they should at least reflect the differing expectations of funders across different disciplines and they are the only definitions that matter when it comes to executing a near- to medium-term research strategy. We need to assess both historic research performance against these impact measures and ask ourselves whether we would have made the grade had we asked the relevant funder(s) to support our work. If not, could we credibly address the gap through focused support? Of course, this only skims the surface and we really need to play a longer game that allows us to influence the impact measures chosen by the funders (reflecting the comments of many colleagues here today).However, my answers are getting too long - need to work on brevity!

It has always struck me that theorists and computational science people are cheap (no requirement for wet labs, and frequently no requirement for equipment) and make a big impact on reputation for a University: theoretical contributions often have wide-ranging impacts, while applied research is often more targeted. Perhaps part of the strategy for supporting researchers should involve a particular aim towards theory and computational science? "

While I believe that the authentic and meaningful use of new digital technology will or should be one of the defining features of a DCU experience, I am particularly struck by the student comments about their current experiences of the technologies they see being used in the classroom and how this relates mainly to presentation tools such as PowerPoint. If as a university (particularly in those of us in education)  we are committed to using technology in transformative ways  - and if we want our students to use technology in transformative ways in their classroom practice – then it needs to be part of their university experience - teaching, learning &amp; assessment and the use of digital technologies should be inextricable.

Being overly firm in opinion is the great enemy of creativity (jumping to conclusions?). Creative ideas tend to surface from a flurry of disparate ideas. Highly creative people have a far greater number of connections between right and left lobes, according to recent neuroscience research. Creating an environment where students are encouraged to question and be questioned has many strands - philosophical, political, skill-based etc. Creativity is tied enormously to tolerance and equality and recognition of the flip side of your opinion. This mindset can be modelled. "

This includes organizing approx 200 students competing, equipment, processing scores and ensuring the safety of each archer by equipment checks. I have also represented DCU by judging at a competition in Maynooth, so this year I acted as judge for approx 600 students in archery.

For example, there could be one podcast with someone from the School of Communications talking about the impact of social media on society, another one with someone from Biotech talking about Transhumanism, another with someone from SALIS talking about challenges and opportunities of immigration etc. I imagine there would be lots of staff volunteering to do a podcast on topics they are passionate about.

These decisions fall upon adults in an area who gather together and make their voices heard.

Even if this is a big amount of money for a student, the reality of life in Dublin makes it difficult to live properly from this money. I cannot but imagine how these matters are for a student who has to work besides and pay scolarity fees:- Expensive and bad deserved services of public transports. - Horrible situation concerning accommodations in Dublin. Paying about 650 euros a month for a miserable room - if the students do not want to share the same bedroom than 10 other people in a cheaper accommodation - is a common thing in Dublin. And that is in the case when it is actually possible to find an accommodation: for the others, it is uncertainty and stress, because they could become homeless from one day to the next. And imagine what it is for a student whose family is abroad (a great part of DCU students are actually not Irish), it simply means nowhere to go to. "

This is often because they don't meet the entry requirements (middle class families invest heavily in their children's second level education and so perform better in the competition for university places (Denny 2010). Working class students most regularly opt for lower status courses, which are shorter and allow them to enter the labour market sooner rather than later. They also more regularly opt for institutions local to where they live so the cost of attendance is minimised. This means IoT's tend to have a higher proportion of working class students. However, the labour market is increasingly demanding that students enter with a least a level 8 qual. so many students with lower level quals find they need to top up and are looking for part-time flexible ways to do this.

I think there might be a value to looking at research from a disciplinary perspective in the first instance and asking whether there are common themes that can be identified. I do accept that this might result in a bland, generic statement but I do think the process of trying to create a disciplinary definition will be helpful at a local Faculty level and could give us an actual definition of why it matters for disciplinary groups at least. The issue of what counts is important because we have to account and there is no escaping this. We also have to be able to demonstrate that what we consider to be research has an impact and is of high quality. There are disciplinary differences when we try to answer these questions - but there are also some common principles ( funding, metrics, publications, social impact etc etc) that we should be wary of moving away from.

The core IT infrastructure is already in place and all our buildings are connected on the Building Management System (BMS)..its moving to the next level is the challenge. "

As many of the contributors will be aware DCU's Community Knowledge Exchange has accomplished a great deal since its' establishment and has shaped the national debate on community-based research and community-based learning but there are challenges. There are other parallel activities and we have sourced what we refer to as \"regionally-relevant research questions\" that have gone to full PhDs. I suggest that one of the key issues is that the success or other of such initiatives, not withstanding resources, is the focus of research supervising staff. Can we incentivise or support staff to develop regionally-related research initiatives in conjunction with the CKE and regional public agencies, civil society organisations and enterprises? We have just submitted a bid with the North Dublin Chamber of Commerce for an IRC-funded PhD scholarship and soon after we submitted the application a colleague in another school mentioned they were engaged in a similar process. How can we capture this activity and learn from it? "

As a science student, it does seem that there's very little overlap between the creative and extracurricular aspects with my learning, and I feel a lot of students in my position in courses such as computing and science do feel to be involved in such they have to sacrifice things academically. Uaneen module as contributory for these courses would be interesting to help prevent the \"sacrificial\" feeling of extra-curricular participation, but in computing's case requires severe restructuring of their courses, which is a difficult hurdle to overcome!

Initiatives like DCU Apps are a huge step forward but procedures for their uptake should be incorporated into everyday working procedures to allow them to be successful, along with sustained training. For example, there is very little need for any paper to be printed anywhere on campus anymore (aside from the degree scrolls). Every single procedure in every department, faculty and school can move to complete paperless operation by allowing all the interaction to take place between staff, between students and between staff and students within DCU apps and other online services. No meeting at any level of the university should take place with paper involved, instead a projector and access to DCU Apps on phones, tablets and laptops is all that’s needed. Once staff start working fully digitally, this will make it easier to understand and deliver a digital experience to students. "

Such a module should broaden students' perspectives and allow them to place everything else they learn and do in this wider ecosystem context. Students would also learn to measure their ecological footprint and what constitutes it, instilling a lifelong commitment to continue reducing it.

Also we are working with our partners at the CREA in the University of Illinois (http://crea.education.illinois.edu/)  to look explicitly at how marginalised groups are disadvantaged by assessment and evaluation practices at all levels of the education system. Simply put if we are not aware that there institutional diversity needs to impact at all levels - including how we teach, learn and assess it is likely that we will fail to create a really inclusive institution.

The idea would be that the content would be accessible to the general public, so not heavily academic, and not presuppose any prior knowledge on the field. I imagine there would be lots of staff volunteering to do a podcast on topics they are passionate about. It could be an interview format or a group discussion. It would be a good way to engage with broader society and showcase our diverse interests, and could also increase our reputation and exposure nationally and internationally at relatively little cost.

Currently this has been used in the rather narrow sense of responding to the future needs of industry but this concept can be expanded to include society. There is little point preparing students for a dead planet. If we are serious about preparing students for the future, the biggest challenge they are going to face in their lifetimes is climate change. If one agrees with Naomi Klein that 'this changes everything' (I do) then university education has to change, otherwise it is in a real sense no longer fit for purpose.  To this end, we could embed sustainability not only as a core value but also as a university wide module that would be part of a DCU core experience. At this stage, looking across the university it seems to me that there is a critical mass of lecturers who could teach into such a module. Of course, I would argue that it is not simply a question of delivering one module but that it is the whole organisation of knowledge in modern universities that has to change but we need to start somewhere.

Academics supervise visits and receive feedback which in turns feeds back to the Programme Chair and wider meetings.  Employers engaged with graduate entry feedback the skills in demand and the professional skills required which is another feedback loop. The timing is challenging for everyone.  Employers are operating in real time as are we.  They find it as challenging if not more than education to forecast the product/services innovation and skill requirements.  Capturing this knowledge is the challenge.   A series of mini audits could be a solution.  Anything too big becomes unwieldy.  What we do know is that automation and robotics is here and will be the major source of innovation.  So what are processes can be automated out and what does the human bring to the table that a robot will never do? "

Upon transitioning to third-level education we not only have to deal with a new grading system, but also with a lack of insight into why we received certain grades. More detailed feedback needs to become standard for all coursework to enable student development. I would even go as far as making rubrics available for all assignments so students know what is expected of them. Coursework rarely changes from year to year so the development of these rubrics shouldn't be too arduous a task for staff. "

We have some experience in this here in the Business School where we have added a ten credit pass/fail \"summer school\" module to final year undergraduate structures.  The idea is to encourage students, many of whom have just finished INTRA placements and have some disposable income to do some travelling, to attend an approved summer school before returning to final year,  If they present to us their transcript from the summer school we then allow them to register for the summer school module in final year.  This not only engourages international engagement but it has the combined benefits of re-introducing students to academic life and significantly lightens the workload burden in final year.  Of course, there is still a significant challenge in actually getting students to avail of the opportunity but this is something we are working on. "

In relation to widening participation for a range of underrepresented groups, its important firstly to find out what the barriers and issues are. Initial research conducted by DCU and its FET partners show that there are a multitude of diverse issues hindering progression for Adults and FET students. Many of these issues relate to the the broader system, such as QA at FET level, DSP, travel, childcare and funding etc. In the meantime DCU and he FET sector could be examining there own practices in relation to pre-entry and post-entry for learners.

One of the biggest impediments to progress is to assume that there is no better way to do something than the way it has always been done and I believe there is something within the discussion you're having with Paul that could signal a better way to do something. We work in knowledge and it resides in people. Why divest ourselves of so many talented researchers because their career trajectory is gated, not by a dearth of research opportunities but by a lack of academic appointments? Why not allow them to build a research career that allows them to engage with School and Faculty through a limited number of lecturing hours (as you have pointed out) rather than funneling them all into the limited number of full-time lectureship opportunities that exist?

Another way of defining research priorities is to look at what is being done in DCU that is not or can not be done elsewhere. Irish-language research - especially in digital formats that can reach Irish-language audiences worldwide - is an example of an area where DCU could, to use the words of Finbarr Bradley, 'capitalise on culture, compete on difference'.

These will have a good impact on our targets for 2020 which we currently stand at 32%, but in line with some of the comments earlier the DCU community grant will fund the upgrade of local poor fuel housing.

There should be incentives around campus surrounding this issue - I see the canteen have stocked a lot of healthy snacks beside the tills recently but the biggest problem I find is during exams (and also during the semester) when students are staying late in the library. There are no facilities to get snacks after the library canteen closes. If the vending machines down there (which are always broken) were working and stocked by staff just before they finish their shift with fresh fruit, protein bars, yoghurts etc., it would be so beneficial for the students and would stop them from snacking on junk food late at night.
